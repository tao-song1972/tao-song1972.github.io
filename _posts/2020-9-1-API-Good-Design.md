title: Good Design of API

1. Standard: Try not create self-defined protocal or mechanism. Use standardised HTTP protocal and RESTful API protocal
2. Compatible: Use version number in URI
3. Abstract: Define clear model. High the business details
4. Simpicity: Follow the least knowledge principal
5. Performance: Thin about the complexity of the business. Try to restrict the options the user can select.
